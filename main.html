      Kedarnath is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language romantic disaster film written
      and directed by Abhishek Kapoor.[4] Featuring Sushant Singh Rajput and
      newcomer Sara Ali Khan in lead roles, it tells an inter-faith love story
      between a wealthy Hindu Brahmin girl whose family owns a lodge and shops
      near the historic Kedarnath Temple in the Uttarakhand mountains and a
      Muslim boy who is a 'pithoo' (porter) working in the same vicinity. As
      their relationship grows closer, the pair face many obstacles, including
      familial disapproval and contrasting backgrounds; when the sudden rains of
      the 2013 Uttarakhand floods devastate the region, the couple are forced to
      survive against the elements and face the ultimate test of their love.[5]
      The film is produced by Ronnie Screwvala of RSVP Movies in his comeback
      feature film venture, and by Pragya Kapoor under Guy in the Sky Pictures,
      with Kanika Dhillon as a co-writer. The film's production began in June
      2012,[6][7] and principal photography commenced on 5 September 2017.[8]
      The film released on 7 December 2018[5] to mixed reviews with praise for
      Rajput's and Khan's performances, cinematography, music and storyline but
      criticism for its VFX, screenplay and overall execution.[9] The film was a
      moderate commercial success.
